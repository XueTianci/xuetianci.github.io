Hi, nice to e-meet you! I am a first-year PhD student at Ohio State University(OSU), advised by [Prof. Huan Sun](https://u.osu.edu/ihudas/people/) and working closely with [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/). I obtained my master's degree from Nanjing University. Previously, I was also a research intern at [Blender NLP](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/), UIUC, working with [Prof. Heng Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z7GCqT4AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research goal is to develop an AI system that empowers humans to better adapt to, understand, and explore this magical world. 

I have broad interests in large language models (LLMs), large multimodal models(LMMs) and related fields.
Recently, I've been focusing on language agents and reasoning. I'm particularly interested in steering LLMs toward self-learning and self-exploration in the wild, with the ultimate goal of achieving expert-level performance in specific domains.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in my research or would like to discuss other research topics further.
