Hi, nice to e-meet you! I am a first-year PhD student at Ohio State University(OSU), advised by Prof. Huan Sun and working closely with Prof. Yu Su. I obtained my masterâ€™s degree from Nanjing University. Previously, I was also a research intern at Blender NLP, UIUC, working with Prof. Heng Ji.

My research interests primarily lie in agents and reasoning. Specifically, I am interested in improving and developing powerful web agents that can interact with online environments to effectively solve various real-world tasks, as well as enhancing reasoning abilities such as R1-style reasoning and long Chain-of-Thought.
